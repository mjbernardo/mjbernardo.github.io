<h3>Here we go...</h3>

<p>Born and raised in the Bay Area, Oakland, CA specifically.  I have two brothers, one older one younger.
My mom has 1 sister and 6 brothers, eight in total and we all live here in the Bay Area.
With that said, I am one of 35 cousins that I am extremely close with; like brothers and sisters.
I am married to my wife Rinabeth and she is an actor/singer/dancer.  You can see her on the regional theatre stages all over the U.S.</p>

<a href="http://www.rinabeth.com/">*Shameless plug - you can visit her website HERE to see her resume!*</a>
<p>My wife and I got married on December 13th, 2014 (121314) and here's a couple photos from that amazing day:</p>

<p>I love to cook!  Often times I imagine myself in an episode of CHOPPED Kitchen to see what I can cook in under 30 minutes.
My wife apprecites it since she's ALWAYS hungry.   Below are a few of my Instagram worthy pictures!  Enjoy!</p>
